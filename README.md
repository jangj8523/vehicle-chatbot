Project Synopsis
------
Amicus means Friend! We are building a car assistant that forms a genuine, bona fide emotional connection and develops a relationship with the driver over time, increasingly learning to support the user's emotional state. The goal is that our assistant becomes a friend to the driver who would miss that friendship in a generic vehicle.

Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft (BMW.F) introduced the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant (IPA) in September 2018, "a new proprietary virtual in-car assistant that will enhance the BMW driving experience" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP-ZzuKAD8k), set to debut in 2019 marking a new era in which drivers increasingly are able to operate their car through voice to access functions and information. The BMW IPA will have the ability to serve the driver in a wide range of ways, from controlling vehicle settings, navigation and entertainment systems to explaining vehicle functions and even conducting a conversation. 

This automative assistant is to be extended with an emotionally expressive avatar that can respond to human emotion and deliver personalized responses to cultivate a deeper, personal relationship with the driver. With the key assumption that the driver's emotional state will be known by the car and provided to the system, this project will be a deep exploration of the frontier that is the structuring and implementation of emotional intelligence in software.

Key project challenges are the determination of the emotional state of the avatar itself in the context of the car/driver state, emotion and facial expression encoding, animation of the avatar based on the structure and implementation of the emotional intelligence framework, and integration with the BMW system. The project will introduce the team to the Microsoft Bot Framework (https://dev.botframework.com/) to which our members have no prior exposure to. Key inspiration comes from sources such as the Chinese company NIO's AI system NOMI (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XJK-oAcVvc).
