Real Customer Profile
=============

“The Young BMW Owner”
------
Our ideal customer for the Amicus product is a younger (e.g. millennial) affluent professional or older student with the disposable income and interest to buy a high end car. Our goal is to attract such a customer to a BMW car as opposed to a similarly positioned competitor brand.

Target customers are likely to be between the ages of 21 and 40, looking to buy a car in the price range of $40,000 to $100,000. Target customers are attracted to higher-end brand name products and utilities in all aspects of their life, and many will own other (non car-related) brand name items, such as Apple products, luxury watches, handbags, and designer clothing. Target customers may have previously owned or also be considering cars made by Mercedes or Audi, and especially in the Silicon Valley, luxury car brands that have broad appeal to a younger, more technologically savvy market, such as Tesla. Target customers, given their age, have likely also grown up around intelligent personal assistants such as Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, and the Google Assistant. As such, given the increased ubiquity of technology in all aspects of modern life, cars with modern features are increasingly attractive to the young professional audience. 

As Amicus is currently a part of BMW software, attracting such individuals to BMW vehicles is important. This demographic tends to spend much of their time on social media platforms, especially Facebook and Twitter, and thus advertising on those platforms is one of the best ways to attract our target customers. In particular, mobile advertising is an ideal way to attract the desired clientele, most of whom spend many hours a day interacting with their mobile smartphones. To raise awareness about the Amicus software, introducing various patented/published accepts of the technology at widely covered technology-centered events like TechCrunch Disrupt is a great way to highlight the innovation present in empathetic artificial intelligence. More generally, getting favorable news coverage by technology-related press will help raise the profile of BMW and Amicus in our target audience’s mind.

As one such example of an ideal customer, we interviewed *Kent Vainio*, a junior at Stanford University who has owned a 2010 BMW 3 Series since September 2017. Kent, who identifies as an American Finnish Londoner, was born in California and stayed in California for a couple of years, but he mainly grew up in London. He is majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Japanese at Stanford. In his free time, Kent enjoys the outdoors, golfing, rock climbing, driving around, and playing video games. He is also interested in technology in general. Kent owns luxury items in addition to his BMW vehicle, such as brand name clothing. He is active on various social media platforms, such as Facebook and occasionally Instagram and Twitter, and is often on YouTube and gaming websites like Kotaku and reddit.

When asked why he owns a 2010 BMW 3 Series in particular (as opposed to other models and other companies’ cars), Kent noted that the main contributing factors were that his parents both own BMWs, BMW cars are generally high quality cars, and he wanted a convertible. The 2010 BMW 3 Series was a relatively well-priced convertible car, and he had encountered a similar car model in the past. He enjoys his convertible -- especially in the spring when he can drive around with the roof down -- and he enjoys having a car to drive around when he plays golf, one of his main hobbies.

When we introduced Kent to our project in CS210A/B of developing an emotionally intelligent IPA with an avatar for in-car use in BMW vehicles, Kent responded:

> “That sounds awesome! The current way you can communicate through voice control is through something like Siri, which is cumbersome because it doesn’t have car-specific features. It’d be nice to have a voice assistant that integrates map and other car related functionality. When you’re driving alone, it’d be nice to have a personal assistant that’s friendly, especially if it learns your likes and dislikes and can chat with you.”

We also asked Kent how he would interact with the IPA. He said that he would ask it questions (calculating routes on maps, playing music, changing radio stations), ask for car-specific functionality (status report of the vehicle, such as low tire pressure, etc. without having to navigate through a menu), and ask for other functionality that people would generally ask of voice assistants like Siri. If he was going on a 10-15 minute drive alone, he would chat with the IPA and ask it questions about the news and interesting things in general. 

Kent has experience using Siri on his iPhone, but he has limited exposure to other voice assistants and in-car assistants. He often uses Siri on his phone for simple hands-off tasks, such as turning on music. He rates Siri quite low in terms of emotional intelligence, as he can never have conversations with Siri, and Siri often provides funny, predetermined responses that don’t actually indicate engagement in a conversation. Overall, he notes that Siri “responds well but is not a sentient avatar.”

Although his parents bought his current car, Kent notes that as a working professional, his own price range for buying a car would depend on his income and what he is looking for in a car. If he is looking for baseline functionality, he would set the upper bar to $30,000, but if he were looking for a car without financial restrictions, he would definitely go for a car with cool technology, such as an advanced avatar and regular technical upgrades to the car. He specifically notes,

> “If BMW had a personal assistant, I’d definitely choose them in the future.”
